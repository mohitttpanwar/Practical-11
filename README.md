🎯 Tracker The Pattern: Code Analysis & Redundancy Resolver

This is a simple, single-file HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application designed to help developers quickly track common coding patterns and identify redundancies within a block of code.

Think of it as a quick, local code audit tool that provides instant, actionable recommendations for improvement!

✨ Key Features

Pattern Tracking: Analyzes the input code to find common, repetitive structures (e.g., specific function calls, loop types, or variable declarations) and counts their occurrences.

Redundancy Resolution: Flags potential code smells and inefficient practices (like repeated logic or overly verbose setups).

Actionable Recommendations: Provides concrete, high-impact suggestions for refactoring and improvement, along with the estimated benefit (e.g., "Reduces load time by 25%").

No Dependencies: It's a single, self-contained HTML file! Just open it in your browser, paste your code, and analyze.

🚀 How to Use It

Open the File: Simply double-click tracker the pattern.html to open it in any modern web browser.

Paste Your Code: Paste the code you wish to analyze (JavaScript, Python, pseudocode, etc.) into the large Text Area.

Analyze: Click the Analyze Patterns button to get a count of identified patterns.

Resolve: Click the Resolve Redundancies button to see specific recommendations for cleaning up your code.

📊 Sample Output

After running the analysis, you will see a structured report:

Identified Patterns

This section lists the exact patterns found and how many times they appeared. This helps you spot where you might need to abstract logic into reusable functions.

For...in Loops: 5 occurrences

Object.keys(): 12 occurrences

Try...catch Blocks: 4 occurrences

Recommendations

This is the heart of the tool, offering clear steps to enhance performance and readability.

Implement a centralized logging module: Improves error traceability and reduces error handling code by 30%.

Migrate repetitive conditional checks to a Switch statement: Simplifies flow control and boosts readability by 50%.

Use Array.map() instead of For loops for transformation: Improves code performance by 25%.

🏗️ Technical Details

This application is built with pure web technologies:

HTML: Provides the structure (text area, buttons, results container).

CSS: Uses inline styles and a pleasant gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2) for a clean, modern interface.

JavaScript: Contains the core logic for parsing the text input, counting patterns, and generating hardcoded mock recommendations based on the analysis type.

(Note: The current JavaScript implementation uses simple string matching for pattern detection and provides pre-defined recommendations. This makes it a great starting point for a more complex static analysis tool!)
